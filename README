Verbatim seeks to be yet another (less shit) music manager. It was born out
of total frustration when using existing music programs available for Linux
and Mac OS X ended in tears for me and bruises for my laptop. Why are some
programs so slow and clunky? Why do they suck so much ass when all they're
dealing with is a small DB of text (ID3 tags) and the odd BLOB?

Anyway... small steps. Presently the world is not yet ready for this software.

In short it must;

* Traverse a (music) root directory
* Maintain a DB of MP3 paths beneath it along with all ID3 tags of each (MP3)
* Index all tags for searching
* Sync to an iPod
* Do not dick around with any tags!
* Do not dick around with the directory structure

Such humble goals.
